    h1 Hello, Adventurer
    
    p Welcome to my portfolio project! Showcased are a few of the projects I've done as part of the Treehouse Fullstack JavaScript Tech Degree. In addition to showing off past projects, this portfolio demonstrates my understanding of Node.js/Express.js, template rendering, and serving static files.

    p Take a look around, make yourself at home, and don't forget to visit the github repo for each project to get to know a little more about my coding style and skills. I'd love to do something cool together!
